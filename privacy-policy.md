**Effective Date:** October 21, 2025

## Introduction

Lightweight Website Blocker ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how the Extension handles user data.

## Data Collection and Storage

The Extension stores the following data locally on your device:

- **Blocked Websites List**: The list of websites you choose to block is stored locally using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API. This data is synced across your Chrome browsers where you are signed in with the same Google account.

- No data is transmitted to external servers or third parties.
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry data is collected.

## Data Sharing

The Extension does not share, sell, or transmit any user data to third parties. All data remains local to your Chrome browser and Google account (via Chrome sync).

## Permissions

The Extension requests the following permissions:

- **declarativeNetRequest**: To block navigation to specified websites
- **declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess**: To apply blocking rules to all websites
- **declarativeNetRequestFeedback**: To provide feedback on blocking rules
- **storage**: To save your list of blocked websites

These permissions are used exclusively for the Extension's core functionality.

## Data Retention

Your blocked websites list is retained until you:
- Manually remove sites from the list
- Uninstall the Extension
- Clear Chrome sync data

## Changes to This Policy

Any updates to this privacy policy will be reflected in the Extension's listing on the Chrome Web Store.
